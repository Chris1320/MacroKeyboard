# Secondary MACRO keyboard for windows
This project is about making a fully functional secondary macro keyboard for windows
This have been done before but i did it in a slightly different way as 95% of all coding will be done in Auto hotkey.
Once you have 2nd_keyboard.lua set up you almost never have to touch it again

### Credit

- TaranVH also did a tutorial on this and it helped me understand LuaMacros [TaranVH/2nd-keyboard](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/tree/master/LUAMACROS)
- Tom scott explained how he got 14 keyboards to work seperately in his video [The Art of the Bodge: How I Made The Emoji Keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U)

Thanks to them for the inspiration for this project

### Here is how to do it if you want to try my code

1. **Download the neccescary programs and files**
    - [LuaMacros](http://www.hidmacros.eu/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=241#p794)
    - [Auto hotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com)
    - This github repository

2. **Get the id of your secondary keyboard**
    - Open up LuaMacros and open the file **Get_key_codes.lua**. You will be prompted to press a button on you secondary keyboard. The program will then output a list of all connected devices. Something like this: 
    ```
    MACROS  :  \\?\HID#VID_045E&PID_0745&MI_00#7&E77A16&0&0000#{884B96C3-56EF-11D1-BC8C-00A0C91405DD} [1049237] :  keyboard
    <unassigned>  :  \\?\ACPI#MSFT0001#4&30E7D4BA&0#{884B96C3-56EF-11D1-BC8C-00A0C91405DD} [65604] :  keyboard
    Total number of devices: 2
    ```
    In my case you see i have two devices connected. MACROS is the divice you just identified by pressing a key on your secondary keyboard. To the right of MACROS we have a long string, This is a combo of the device type and id. My secondary keyboard has the id: PID_0745 you find the id between the 2 first &. Example: 
    ?\HID#VID_045E **&PID_0745&** MI_00#7&E77A16&0&0000#{884B96C3-56EF-11D1-BC8C-00A0C91405DD}
    Note down your keyboard id. You will need it at step 4.

3. **Configure file: 2nd_keyboard.lua** 
    - Open up LuaMacros and open the file **2nd_keyboard.lua**. Now change the variable kbID with the keyboard id you just notet
    ```
    local kbID = 'You secondary keyboard id';'
    ```

4. **Run it and cross you fingers** 
    - With **2nd_keyboard.lua** open in LuaMacros click the little blue play button this will run the program hopefully without errors. Now double click on the file **Main.ahk** this will run it and you will see a little green H in your task bar. Try and type 5 on your numberpad on the secondary keyboard. If your keyboard types ðŸ¤¯ Congrats you know have a secondary MACRO keyboard. All macros can be configured in the Main.ahk file
